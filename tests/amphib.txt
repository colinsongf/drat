Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians. Amphibian comes from a Greek
word that means double life. Amphibians begin their life cycle as water animals.
They develop into air-breathing animals as they grow up.
Female amphibians lay their eggs in wet places. The eggs are covered with a
jelly-like material to protect them. The eggs hatch into larvae, or tadpoles.
Tadpoles swim in the water and grow legs. When they are adults, amphibians
live on land and breathe air.
Toad tadpoles grow up quickly. It takes them only a few months to lose their
tails and become small toads. After that, it may take as long as three years to
become full-grown adults! Toads have been known to live 30 to 40 years.
When frog eggs hatch into tadpoles it takes them a very long time to grow up.
Several years can go by before the tadpoles become frogs.
