Until the 1940's, there were no specific
psychiatric drugs. Bromides, barbiturates, and
opiates were known to sedate disturbed
patients but did not reverse the symptoms of
severe mental illnesses such as the
schizophrenias or manic-depressive
psychoses. They did ameliorate anxiety, but
only at the cost of fogging the minds of the
recipients, who had to decide between being
unhappy and being intoxicated. In the 1950â€™s,
the first specific drug appeared:
chlorpromazine (trade name Thorazine). It
was synthesized when an antihistamine
chemical relative was found to sedate surgical
patients. However, clinical observations
showed that this drug did much more than
simply.
